##About Me

Currently working as a .NET developer at <a href="http://www.searchlaboratory.com">Search Laboratory</a> and playing
around with F# & other fun things outside of work.

I also like Red Fedoras

##About My Blog

This blog uses a slightly customised [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) template for the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) platform.

Blog posts are either written in markdown or as F# script files which are later converted to markdown using [F# formatting](http://tpetricek.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/) using 
a process very similar to the one described by Colin Bull in his [blog](http://www.colinbull.net/2014/11/04/Blogging-with-FSharp/).
